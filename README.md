# üê¢ Turtlesim Project with ROS2  

## About  
This project utilizes **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** and the **Turtlesim** package to demonstrate the basics of robotic simulation, control, and navigation. It serves as an introduction to ROS2 concepts, including topics, services, and action servers, applied in a fun and interactive way using Turtlesim.

## üåü Features  

- **ROS2 Concepts**:  
  - Implementing publishers, subscribers, and services in ROS2.  
  - Interaction with Turtlesim for movement and control.  

- **Turtle Control**:  
  - Programmatically control the turtle's movement using custom scripts.  
  - Execute commands like drawing shapes, moving to specific positions, and avoiding obstacles.  

- **Simulation and Visualization**:  
  - Visualize turtle movements and behavior in the Turtlesim environment.

- Working knowledge of ROS2 command-line tools.  

### Steps to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sim43/Turtlesim-Project-ROS2.git
   cd Turtlesim-Project-ROS2
2. Source your ROS2 Workspace:  
   ```bash
   source /opt/ros/<your_ros2_distribution>/setup.bash
3. Build the workspace Workspace:  
   ```bash
   colcon build
